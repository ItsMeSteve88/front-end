SEO => Search Engine Optimization.

Certain tags help search engines parse your code much easier

Encoding
    => Formats of data

DNS 
    => Domain name server
    => Google.com for example
    => yourowncompany.com 

So depending on what you are looking for, a domain name on a server can be expensive
If it is a popular keyword, it is more costly, less popular keyword is less costly

=> https://www.godaddy.com/en-uk/domains

=> travel.com -- expensive
=> travelxyz.com -- cheaper

So you buy the domain name on a server, then your ip is linked to that domain name
