Types of CSS:

1. Inline
    => It is written along with html codes as an html attribute
    => not a good practice, harder to read and maintain code.
2. Internal
    => Within the head tag 
    => Not a good practice
3. External
    => Separate CSS file



Inline CSS
    => Written in the tag
<div style="background-color: red;</div>




Internal CSS 
CSS Selectors:
    => Help you to select element/elements where styles need to be applied.
    => Examples are: ID, Tag, Class or *

ID
    => Apply unique styles. Can be applied to one control only

ID: <div id="collection"?
#collection {
    background-color: red;
}

Tag
    => Applies style to all matching tags in your html.
h3 {
    color: blue;
}
<d3>join us<h3>
The above text will become blue.


Class 
    => A custom css configuration to apply on different elements.
    Able to apply css to multiple elements, with different tags.
.text-wrapper{
border: 1px solid pink;
}
<span class ="text-wrapper"> This is Span 1</span>
<div class ="text-wrapper"> Another Div</div>
The above elements will have pink borders

* 
    => Will apply to all elements in the page, it is the lowest priority, therefore it
    Will apply only to elements that do not have css applied
*{
    color: aqua;
}
Will color all elements that do not already have css, aqua



External CSS
    => Write CSS in another file and link it to your page

<link rel="stylesheet" href="joinus.css">
