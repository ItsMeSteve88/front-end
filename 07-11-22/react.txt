    => What is React?
        JS Library for front end development
    => Why do we need it?
        Why do we need libraries?
            => Inbuild functions/features.
            => Reduce time and effort to develop apps
    => How does it work?
        1. Component based architecture
            What is a component
                => Part of Ui or a whole page
                => Code that can be reused multiple times without being rewritten over and over and over and over
                => Easy to maintain/make changes fast
        2. Virtual DOM
            What is DOM?
                => Document Object Model. -> JS
                => Tree representation of UI[the HTML page]

                                            HTML
                        HEAD                                BODY
                LINK     TITLE    SCRIPT        HEADER          FORM             FOOTER
        
                                             SEARCH  LOGO    INPUT BUTTONS     LINKS Close Text
            Tree traversal
            BFS [Breath first search]
            -> HTML-HEAD-BODY-LINK-TITLE-SCRIPT-HEADER-FORM-FOOTER-SEARCH-LOGO


            DFS [Depth first search]
            -> HTML-HEAD-LINK-TITLE-SCRIPT-BODY-HEADER-SEARCH-LOGO-FORM-INPUT-BUTTONS

            1. observe mouse movements
            2. as soon as muse stops, find the element
            3. Traverse the tree to find the element.
            4. Update the tree

        3. JSX
                => JavaScript extension
                => Gives you the ability to use JS and HTML together.
    => How to use it?
