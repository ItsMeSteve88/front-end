Complex data.

for example:

Student => id: 1 , name: John Doe, subjects: [computer science, human psychology]

the same data stored as an array would look like:

Array = [98, "John Doe", "CS", "HP"]

the same data stored as an object would look like:

var student = {
    id:1,
    name: "John Doe",
    subjects: ["CS", "Match", "Psychology"],
    address:{
        buildingNo: 25,
        streetNo:5,
        city: "NYC"
        Country: "USA"
    }

}

Objects are stored as key/value pairs.
