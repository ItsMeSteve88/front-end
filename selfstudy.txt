This is me working alone on my studies
hosting on my git

If i want to add a commit using the terminal I would 
git add . (to add the changes to the staging area)
and then  
git commit -m (message) "and then say what has changed"
and push the changes to the master/main branch"# front-end selfstudy"

Modifying text as a test, I will then add the changes using git add and (filename) to add specific files that have been changed
Using "touch" and then filename, allows me to add a new file to my directory
